    <h1>Insurance premium charges prediction Project Objectives:-</h1>
    <p>The Insurance Premium Charges Prediction project aims to predict the cost of insurance 
        premiums for individuals based on various factors such as age, gender, BMI (Body Mass Index),
         smoking status, number of children, and geographical region. By creating a machine learning 
         model, the project helps insurance companies assess the potential risks associated with an 
         individual and estimate the premium charges accurately..</p>

    <h2>Project Motivation:</h2>
    <p>Insurance companies face challenges in determining the appropriate premium for customers</p>
    <p>to the variety of personal factors that influence the risk and cost of insurance. By</p>
    <p>analyzing historical data, we can predict future premiums using machine learning, thus </p>
    <p>accuracy and ensuring fair pricing for both the customer and the insurer.</p>
    <p>It involves a contract (known as an insurance policy) between an individual or entity </p>
    <p>(the policyholder) and an insurance company.</p>

    <h2>PROJECT GOALS:-</h2>
    <p>The goal of this project is to predict the premium charges for insurance policies based on 
        various factors such as age, gender, BMI, number of dependents, smoking habits, and geographical
         region. This project leverages machine learning techniques to create a predictive model that 
         helps insurance companies estimate the risk associated with a particular individual and thus, 
         calculate the appropriate premium amount.</p>
                                 <p>Key Objectives:</p>
<p>1.Understanding: Analyze the data to understand the relationships between different factors (age, BMI, smoker status, etc.) and the insurance premium charges.

    Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (like gender and region), and scaling numerical features.

<p>2.Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize the data to uncover patterns and correlations between features and insurance charges.

<p>3.Building: Develop multiple machine learning models such as:

<p>4.Regression: To predict premium charges using a simple and interpretable model.
    Decision Trees and Random Forests: To capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features.
